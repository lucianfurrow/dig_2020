            <p>The chicken has feathers, funny feet, likes to explore little by little. Chickens are actually quite smart. If a chicken gets scared in a spot that they explore, it takes them time to go back to it. They are cuddly. Their feet can be different colors. They have wings, but they donâ€™t really fly. They have combs on their heads.</p>

            <p>The chicken lives in areas with dirt, grass, and high places to roost. Chickens came from Southeast Asia. They were around 10,000 - 8,000 years ago. The only wild chicken now is the Red Junglefowl. It lives in Southeast Asia. </p>
